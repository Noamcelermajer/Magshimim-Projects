# Magshimim-Projects Monorepo

This monorepo contains a collection of projects developed during my time in Magshimim. Each project represents a milestone in my programming journey and showcases my growth as a developer.

## MagshiTrivia

MagshiTrivia is a multiplayer trivia game that consists of a C++ server and a C# WPF client. It demonstrates my knowledge of C++ and my ability to adapt to new challenges, as I learned C# and WPF within a short timeframe to develop this project.

### Features

- **Server**: The C++ server handles multiple client connections and implements the game logic for the trivia game.
- **Client**: The C# WPF client provides a user-friendly interface for players to connect to the server, participate in the trivia game, and view real-time updates.

### Technologies Used

- **Server**: C++ with multithreading.
- **Client**: C# (WPF - Windows Presentation Foundation).

### Highlights

- **Multithreading**: The server utilizes multithreading to handle concurrent connections and ensure a smooth multiplayer experience.
- **Game Logic**: The server implements the trivia game logic, including question selection, scoring, and real-time updates to connected clients.
- **Network Communication**: The server and client communicate via network sockets to exchange game data and enable multiplayer interactions.

### Learning Experience

MagshiTrivia provided me with an opportunity to quickly learn and apply C# and WPF concepts. It showcases my adaptability, problem-solving skills, and ability to deliver a functional application in a limited timeframe.

# MagshiTrivia

MagshiTrivia is a multiplayer trivia game consisting of a C++ server and a C# WPF client. It demonstrates my proficiency in C++ and showcases my ability to adapt to new challenges, as I learned C# and WPF within a short timeframe for this project.

## Features

- **Server**: The C++ server implements the game logic, communication with clients, and handles multiple concurrent connections using multithreading.
- **Client**: The C# WPF client provides an interactive user interface for players to connect to the server, participate in the trivia game, and view real-time updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Server**: C++ with multithreading.
- **Client**: C# (WPF - Windows Presentation Foundation).

## Project Highlights

- **Multithreading**: The server utilizes multithreading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, allowing a smooth and responsive multiplayer experience.
- **Game Logic**: The server implements the trivia game logic, including question selection, scoring, and real-time updates to all connected clients.
- **Communication**: The server and client communicate via network sockets to exchange game data and enable multiplayer interactions.

## Learning Experience

MagshiTrivia challenged me to quickly learn and apply C# and WPF concepts within a limited timeframe. It showcases my adaptability, problem-solving skills, and ability to deliver a functional application in a short span of time.
